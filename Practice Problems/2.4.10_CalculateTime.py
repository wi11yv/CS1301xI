#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Let's try something trickier! The variables above represent
#the start time for a run as well as the length of the run
#in minutes. The original values, for example, show a run
#that started at 3:48 and lasted 172 minutes.
#
#Add some code below that will print the time at which the
#run will end, using normal formatting (e.g. 6:40 for the
#original data above). To do this, you'll need to somehow
#find both the hours and minutes of the new time, convert
#both to strings, and add those to the colon ":" to print
#the time.
#
#You may assume that the length of the run will never cross
#12:59 (e.g. you don't have to worry about going from
#12:59 to 1:00 or 23:59 to 0:00). You also don't need to
#worry about the lack of 0 in front of single-digit minute
#counts (e.g. it's fine to show 5:07 as 5:7).


#Add your code here!
